## Phylogenetic tree of early SARS-CoV-2 sequences
This tree shows one possible rooting.
See [https://nextstrain.org/groups/jbloomlab/narratives/SARS2-rooting/early-SARS2-trees-v1](https://nextstrain.org/groups/jbloomlab/narratives/SARS2-rooting/early-SARS2-trees-v1) for a Nextstrain narrative that describes other possible rootings.

See [https://github.com/jbloom/early-SARS2-trees](https://github.com/jbloom/early-SARS2-trees) for the computer code, data, and other details.

You can use the *Color By* box in the upper right to color the sequences by:

  - number of mutations relative to the inferred recombinant common ancestor (recCA) of SARS-CoV-2
  - number of mutation relative to the bat coronavirus RaTG13
  - sample collection date
  - identity at sites 8782 and 28144 (eg, lineage A, lineage B, intermediate)
  - additional annotations including if an early sample from the Huanan Seafood Market

Sequences are from Genbank, NGDC, and GISAID.
